I hope it will be helpful for you.

## 🚀 Last Version's Drawbacks and Improvements
- ❌ **Repetitive buy and sell with one wallet**: The last version of the Raydium Volume Bot used fixed wallets, so it was apparent on DexScreener that some wallets performed repetitive buy and sell actions.
- ✅ **Transferring SOL to new wallet**: After buying and selling in one wallet, it transfers SOL to a newly created wallet and continues buying and selling there.
- ❌ **No increase in the number of makers**: It didn't increase the number of pool makers, only the volume.
- ✅ **Maker increase**: New wallets are created every round of buying and selling, increasing the number of makers.
- ❌ **Gathering token instead of SOL**: When gathering, if there were tokens left, it didn't sell them before gathering. Instead, it just gathered tokens to the main wallet.
- ✅ **Sell before gather**: When gathering, if there are tokens left in the wallet, it sells the tokens first and gathers only SOL (the token account rent of 0.00203 SOL is reclaimed).
- ❌ **Equal number of buys and sells**: One-time buy and one-time sell actions left sell pressure at the end, as there was always a sell at the end of the volume operation.
- ✅ **More buys than sells**: It randomly buys twice with SOL in the wallet and sells all tokens after some time, making the number of buys twice as many as sells, thus creating more buy pressure.

# Version 3 is also developed.
### Version 3 is designed for the massive transactions in a very short time.
So, it is making 500 transactions in a minute.
You can see my volume bot version3 working in here.

https://dexscreener.com/solana/boisf5dnefrbsodmiupkpauglaggx9gdjl1csgmcjqnn

There is no repeated makers and it is making 20 transactions a second.

If you increase the volume of each transaction, 1 million in an hour is a piece of cake.
How wonderful it is.
I am proud of my version3.
